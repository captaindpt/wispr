🎉 MAJOR SUCCESS: Wispr Flow clone fully functional! User wrote message with the app.
✅ Perfect behavior: Hold Fn → accumulate speech with pauses → Release Fn → paste complete transcript
🔧 Next: Fix inconsistent behavior from rapid key presses and connection stability.

### 2025-06-24 11:33
🎉 MILESTONE: Wispr Flow clone fully functional! User successfully wrote message with it.
✅ Perfect behavior: Fn key hold → accumulate speech → release → paste complete transcript
✅ Fixed all major issues: v3 API, transcript accumulation, proper timing
⚠️ Next: Improve stability for rapid key presses and connection robustness

### 2025-06-24 11:31
🎉 Fixed transcript accumulation! Now concatenates all speech segments during Fn press.
✅ Perfect behavior: Hold Fn → accumulate speech → Release Fn → paste full transcript.

### 2025-06-24 11:25
🎉 Wispr Flow working! v3 API + better connection management = perfect transcription.
⚠️ Memory corruption on cleanup causes crashes - suggest moving to AssemblyAI SDK.

### 2025-06-24 11:23
✅ Upgraded to AssemblyAI v3 streaming API - transcription works! Error 4003 resolved.
⚠️ New issue: Getting 1008 policy violations on reconnects, leads to segfault.

### 2025-06-24 10:22
Fixed Fn key detection using NSEvent instead of pynput. Should now properly detect Fn press/release.
# Wispr Flow Clone - Development Log

### 2024-12-19 12:55
✅ Audio feedback system complete! Replaced goofy bubbly sounds with soft, subtle notification tones. Added custom sound installation system and professional sound source recommendations.

### 2024-12-19 12:50
✅ Added audio feedback feature with press/release sounds. Integrated into both test and production versions. Configurable volume and enable/disable options.

### 2024-12-19 12:45
✅ Production deployment system complete! Created deploy.sh script that installs Wispr as a macOS LaunchAgent service. Includes proper logging, health checks, auto-recovery, and wispr command for service management.

### 2024-12-19 12:40
✅ Production service created (wispr_service.py) with comprehensive logging, rotating files, error recovery, health checks, statistics tracking, and proper signal handling.

### 2024-12-19 12:35
✅ CLI test version working perfectly. Real-time transcription confirmed working with AssemblyAI API. Environment variables loaded from .env file.

### 2024-12-19 12:30
✅ Core application complete. Created wispr_flow.py with Fn key detection, audio recording, AssemblyAI integration, and auto-paste functionality.

### 2024-12-19 12:25
✅ Improved version with multiple trigger keys (fn, right_cmd, caps_lock, etc). Better error handling and compatibility.

### 2024-12-19 12:20
✅ Background launcher service created. Can run as daemon with keep-alive functionality.

### 2024-12-19 12:15
✅ Setup script and comprehensive README created. Auto-installs portaudio and Python dependencies.

### 2024-12-19 12:10
✅ Project structure established with requirements.txt and proper macOS integration via pyobjc.

### 2024-12-19 12:00
Started fresh repository for Wispr Flow clone. Goal: Fn key hold -> record -> transcribe -> paste at cursor on macOS. 
### 2025-06-24 10:17
Fixed Fn key issue - switched to right_cmd trigger. Service running and ready to test.

### 2025-06-24 11:06
Fixed Fn key detection! Using Cocoa APIs and flag-based detection (0x800000). Works but needs debouncing - too sensitive.

### 2025-06-24 11:16
Fixed AssemblyAI streaming error 4003. Increased audio buffer to 3200 frames (200ms) to meet API minimums.
